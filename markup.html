        <p>One afternoon I said to myself,<br>
        <strong>"Why isn't the rain raining heavier?"</strong><br>
        <em>Does the cloud not seem to cry today?<br>
        or does it not?</em></p>

        <p>One afternoon I said to myself,<br>
        <strong>"Why isn't my life more sunny?"</strong><br>
        <em>Is it because the cloud covers my cloudy heart?<br>
        or does it not?</em></p>
        
        <p>I saw myself in a dark plane. <br>
        As I see myself dancing again.<br>
        Now this feeling is a thing. <br>
        <em>To get me wondering on how to create this poem again.</em></p>
