            Paul William Walker IV</a> (September 12, 1973 â€“ November 30, 2013) was an American actor. He is best known for his role as Brian O'Conner in the Fast & Furious franchise.
            Walker began his career as a child actor during the 1970s and 1980s, and gained recognition in the early 1990s after appearing in the television soap opera The Young and the 
            Restless. He received praise for his performances in the teen film She's All That and the coming-of-age film Varsity Blues (both 1999), before gaining international fame after 
            starring in The Fast and the Furious (2001).</p> 
                
        <p>Walker then starred in the commercially successful road thriller Joy Ride (2001), which led to a reputation as an action star. This continued with his performances in box-office 
            disappointments Into the Blue (2005) and Running Scared (2006). Walker also earned praise in other genres, like in the survival drama Eight Below, and for his portrayal of Hank 
            Hansen the war film Flags of Our Fathers (both 2006). Outside of these, Walker then largely appeared in low budget action films, but starred in the commercially successful heist 
            film Takers (2010).</p>
        
        <p>Walker died on November 30, 2013 at the age of 40 as a passenger in a single-car crash alongside friend and driver Roger Rodas thought to be caused by driving into a gas pipe. 
            Walker's father and daughter filed separate wrongful death lawsuits against Porsche, which resulted in settlements. At the time of his death, Walker had not completed filming 
            Furious 7 (2015), which was completed after rewrites and stand-ins, including his brothers Cody and Caleb, filled in for Walker. The song "See You Again" by Wiz Khalifa and 
            Charlie Puth was commissioned for the film's soundtrack as a tribute to Walker.</p>
