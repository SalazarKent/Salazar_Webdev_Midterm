        <p>One afternoon I said to myself,<br>
        "Why isn't the rain raining heavier?"<br>
        Does the cloud not seem to cry today?<br>
        or does it not?</p>

        <p>One afternoon I said to myself,<br>
        "Why isn't my life more sunny?"<br>
        Is it because the cloud covers my cloudy heart?<br>
        or does it not?</p>
        
        <p>I saw myself in a dark plane. <br>
        As I see myself dancing again.<br>
        Now this feeling is a thing. <br>
        To get me wondering on how to create this poem again.</p>
